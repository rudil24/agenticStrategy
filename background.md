# Background - rudil24

This started in July 2024 after I was WFR'ed from Intuit. After a month of feeling sorry for myself,
I wrote this on some site somewhere:

With that I put together a learning plan:

* Learned the PERN Stack and dabbled in blockchain development (Motoko)
* Learned prompt-window level LLM assistance at coding (GitHub copilot, WindSurf, Supermaven, and Gemini)
* Messed around with some keystones & pet projects
* Kept hitting the Copilot & Gemini free limits like a crack addict
* Purchased Google AI Pro in August 2025
* Made some more useful stuff
* Went through entire Python training using markdown README.md's as PRD and Design Doc.
  * didn't JUST use AI, got a solid working knowledge of the Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy Stack (and dabbled in data science via Jupyter Notebooks)

So now I'm ready to go agentic!
