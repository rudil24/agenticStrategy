# One Person Software Team - Rudi Lewis

This repo documents how I'm building an AI software team and improving the agentic workflows iteratively over a number of projects. You can see more about [my background](./background.md).

## Project Goals

1. My current goal is to create __*silky smooth agent-powered workflows*__, specifically in the software space. To achieve this, I'll iterate on my current clunky workflows, as I work through useful and/or fun projects that serve a productivity and/or entertainment purpose in my life and those around me.

2. My long-term goal is to build or join a viable business with the hardened team and workflows I create, with like-minded individuals who want to steer the world toward human/AI harmony, and hopefully __NOT__ "Beyond Thunderdome".

## Rev 0.1: Vibe + Chat

My first effort wasn't really a team as much as a Gemini chat session to build a quick & dirty 100% client-side [fantasy draft ping pong ball hopper](https://github.com/rudil24/draftballs), as I was learning React. It helped me see I wanted something more than chat + vibing to make things, I wanted to build an AI scrum team.

## Rev 0.2: Anatomy of a Team

I worked with Gemini 2.5 to create a ["team" roster (initial version)](https://github.com/rudil24/guestbook/tree/main/team) and we worked together through interactive prompts to create a simple javascript full stack [guestbook demo](https://github.com/rudil24/guestbook). I envisioned having an agent lead the action of agent experts. But all it really became was me talking to Gemini in a chat pane, then Gemini would drop below the counter and put on a new hat like a Monty Python hotel sketch. Me having to "Deactivate agent Stella. Activate agent Nexus" and micro-manage every task got the project done, but with too much effort on my part.

## Rev 0.3: I Plan, You Do

I worked through the first 80 days of 100 Days of Code learning the Python language while refining my approach. I tried to NOT do interactive chat, other than a single prompt that pointed Gemini to a README.md for each project (kind of a combined Product Requirements Doc an Design/Dev Workflow doc all in one. Example 1, Example 2, Example 3.)

## Rev 0.4: One Team, Two Stacks

The strategy is to build __one team__ that grows its __knowledge, memory, and teamwork__ as it works through successive projects, independent of the AI-enabled product development "stack" it is using. Can I build a true agentic team that will coordinate efforts AND work autonomously, within scope, and take that knowledge forward for future projects? Anthropic thinks I can, __if__ I use Claude Code and the latest (Opus 4.6) tools. Google also thinks I can, __if__ I use their new Antigravity integrated development environment (IDE) combined with their Gemini 3.0 Pro agentic workflows. Who's right? Let's try both! 

### The Team



* Google stack:
* 

#### Product Owner

#### Team Lead

#### Team of Agent Specialists

In my, the great instructor [David McLachlan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uqqZwyoW303ZeWyUiNdMg) always talks about "T-shaped people". "T-shaped agents", they are all fluent in any of the coding languages I know,
but

### The Process

Project management

* Scope & feasibility
* Planning
* Development
* Test
* Deploy. All of this is hokum if I don't __ship real code__.

### The Workload



### The Tools

![devTools_06_Dark.svg](devTools_06_Dark.svg)

For my Google "stack" I try to source Google products wherever I can.
My Claude "stack" uses Claude/Anthropic products wherever it can, 
and best in class wherever it cannot (unless Google IS best in class, 
then it uses a viable option. example: FLUX instead of Google NanoBanana for image gen)

#### Google Stack (using Google AI tools wherever possible)

#### Claude Stack (hybrid best-in-class)

#### Deployment Environments

Serverless: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud,
Platform as a Service: Firebase, Heroku, Hostinger, Netlify, PythonAnywhere, Railway, Render, Vercel, ...
I did a breakdown of how to host python/flask apps on [Python-primed PaaS](https://github.com/rudil24/pythonCourse/blob/main/solutions/day071/README.md)

### Key Outputs

* Context Logging: What the team did, how it worked, for future
