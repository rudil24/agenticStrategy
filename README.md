# One Person Software Team - rudil24

This repository is mainly markdown text, it describes and archives how I'm building an agentic software team and improving the agentic workflows in my team iteratively over a number of projects.

## Background

I'm a career engineer who's been in tech since 1990 and done everything from transmission & voice network provisioning to C-suite a couple of tech-driven companies.
You can see more about [my background](./background.md) and what brought me to driving daily toward agentic software development.

## Project Goals

1. My current goal is to reduce friction between human and agentic work in tech fields, specifically software research and development, to make truly sublime agentic workflows, by iterating on my current clunky workflows as I make some useful and/or fun projects that serve a productivity and/or entertainment purpose in my life and those around me.

2. My long-term goal is to look at the viability of building a business with that team, with like-minded individuals who want to make humans and AI mesh into something that pushes humanity and industry forward, and hopefully AWAY from something that looks like Mad Max.

## Rev 0.1

My first effort wasn't really a team as much as a Gemini chat session to build a quick & dirty 100% client-side [fantasy draft ping pong ball hopper](https://github.com/rudil24/draftballs) as I was learning React. That's when the idea hit me I wanted something more than chat+vibe to make projects, I wanted a full scrum team.

## Rev 0.2

I worked with Gemini 2.5 to create a ["team" roster (initial version)](https://github.com/rudil24/guestbook/tree/main/team) to create a simple javascript full stack [guestbook demo](https://github.com/rudil24/guestbook). I envisioned having an AI team lead named "Cap" manage the action of the other experts. But all it really became was me talking to chat in left pane as it drooped below the counter and put on a new hat like a Monty Python hotel sketch. "activate agent Nexus" just wasn't what I was going for.

## My One Person Environment Rev 0.2 → 0.3

For Rev 0.3, I'm looking to

### The Team

#### Product Owner

#### Team Lead

#### Team of Agent Specialists

In my, the great instructor David McLachlan always talks about "T-shaped people". "T-shaped agents", they are all fluent in any of the coding languages I know,
but

### The Workload - Current and Future

Currently I'm coding projects, i want to move to agentic and do it in two paths: A Google path and a Claude path.
I'm picking those because I think they "win" in the end, for software app development, at least.

### The Tools

![devTools_06_Dark.svg](devTools_06_Dark.svg)

For my Google "stack" I try to source Google products wherever I can.
My Claude "stack" uses Claude/Anthropic products wherever it can, 
and best in class wherever it cannot (unless Google IS best in class, 
then it uses a viable option. example: FLUX instead of Google NanoBanana for image gen)

#### Google Stack (using Google AI tools wherever possible)

#### Claude Stack (hybrid best-in-class)

#### Deployment Environments

Serverless: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud,
Platform as a Service: Firebase, Heroku, Hostinger, Netlify, PythonAnywhere, Railway, Render, Vercel, ...

### Key Outputs

* Context Logging: What the team did, how it worked, for future
