# Development Tools - Rudi Lewis

Can I build a true agentic team that will coordinate efforts AND work autonomously, within scope, and take that knowledge forward for future projects? Anthropic thinks I can, __if__ I use Claude Code and the latest (Opus 4.6) tools. Google also thinks I can, __if__ I use their new Antigravity integrated development environment (IDE) combined with their Gemini 3.0 Pro agentic workflows. Who's right? Let's try both!

* A __Google__ "integrated" stack featuring *Google Antigravity* IDE, *Google Stitch* for wireframes, *Google AI Studio* for any multimedia assets, and *Google CLI* for managing the team and the action at the command line.
* A __Claude Code__ "best in class" stack that features the tried and true *VS Code* for the IDE, *Claude Artifacts* + a tool integration with *Figma* for wireframes, tool integration(s) for multimedia needs (current thinking: *Flux.2* from Black Forest Labs), and of course *Claude Code* managing the team and the action at the command line.

For my Google "stack" I try to source Google products wherever I can. My Claude "stack" uses Claude/Anthropic products wherever it can, and best in class wherever it cannot (unless Google IS best in class, then it uses a viable option. example: FLUX instead of Google NanoBanana for image gen.)

## One stack for each end-to-end project

I plan to follow a project through from start to completion in one environment (but that's not written in stone.) As I go forward, I might find different strengths from different toolsets in different phases.

As a side quest i'll work to have the team comprise a list of web app hosting service providers and some of the specialization and cost. (serverless, managed server, platform as a service, etc.) See [appHosting.md](./appHosting.md) for more details.
