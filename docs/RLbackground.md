# Background - rudil24

I'm a career engineer who's been in tech since 1990 and done everything from transmission & voice network provisioning to C-suite a couple of tech-driven companies.

## what brought me to driving daily toward agentic software development

This started in July 2024 after I was WFR'ed from Intuit. After a month of feeling sorry for myself,
I wrote this on some site somewhere:
> __My Why:__

> Don't get me wrong, PMs do important awesome talented work to vision a product, \

> I had a great time doing both of those, but I'm aged out. \

> So I'm going back to my 1s and 0s roots, diving deep into fullstack webdev, and loving it!

With that I put together a learning plan:

* [Learned the PERN Stack](https://github.com/rudil24/PERNBootCamp_DrYu) and dabbled in blockchain canister development (ICP/Motoko)
* Learned prompt-window level LLM assistance at coding (GitHub copilot, WindSurf, Supermaven, and Gemini)
* Messed around with some keystones & pet projects
* Kept hitting the Copilot & Gemini free limits like a crack addict
* Purchased Google AI Pro in August 2025
* Made some more useful stuff
* Went through entire [Python training first 80 of 100 days](https://github.com/rudil24/pythonCourse), first learning all the components, then using markdown README.md's as PRD and Design Doc for agent to build first revs.
  * didn't JUST use AI, got a solid working knowledge of the Python/Flask/SQLAlchemy Stack (and dabbled in data science via Jupyter Notebooks)

So now, with the Python course in the final weeks of keystone projects, what better time than now to go agentic!
