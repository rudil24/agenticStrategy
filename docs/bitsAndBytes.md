# The Bits and Bytes of OPST

Where do my coding assets live? Where does my source code live? How and where do I deploy source and birth the babies?

## Digital Footprint (Build)

![Build Digital Footprint](buildDF.svg)

* The root or home workspace has a distinction between the _OPST and the individual projects they build. That way, the team advancement is decoupled from the project itself.
* A GLOBAL_EVOLUTION.md is maintained that tracks the evolution of the team's skills and capabilities.
* A CLAUDE.md is there to orient Claude that he isn't the only show in town and the GLOBAL_EVOLUTION.md is the rulemaker

> I've gotta say, the assets discovery of this OPST strategy has been an amazing, delightful experience in the year of our Lord 2026. Apparently I'm not the only person to think that it would be cool to have AI accrue skills and find ways to naturally makeconnections between themselves. /s

Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in the OPST assets:

* __AGENTS__: Defines the personas, roles, and instructions for the different AI team members.
* __DOCS__: Contains global documentation, templates (like PRDs), and architecture standards shared across projects.
* __MCPs__: Holds Model Context Protocol definitions (and json snippets to connect to external MCP Servers) to securely connect the agents to external tools, databases, and APIs.
  * See a [great catalog of available MCP's across the world](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers)
* __SKILLS__: A library of instructions and resources that extend the team's capabilities for specialized, complex tasks.
  * See the [amazing agent skills people are creating](https://skillsmp.com/)
* __RULES__: Global rules of engagement, constraints, and coding standards that the team must follow.
* __WORKFLOWS__: Well-defined, step-by-step repeatable processes (like project kickoffs) for the team.
* __COMMANDS__: Standardized CLI commands or scripts to automate common actions.
* __HOOKS__: Automation hooks that trigger specific actions during the development lifecycle.

*(Note: The `buildDF.svg` categorizes AGENTS, DOCS, MCPs, and SKILLS as assets that BOTH Claude and Google Antigravity "fw" / utilize together.)*
